## Intro
Here you'll find the complete software repository for Team Pheasant's **_full score run_** for the 2021 World Robot
Olympiad (WRO) Regular Category Senior competition.

We're Team Pheasant — Tianshi, Brian, and Stephanie from Hwa Chong Institution in Singapore; we participated in WRO 2021
through the Singapore National Robotics Competition, working over thousands of hours, writing over ten thousand lines of
code, and making hundreds of hardware revisions. Sadly, due to the Covid-19 pandemic here, we couldn't join the rest of
the international robotics community for WRO.

Instead, we're leaving this here to aid and inspire future generations of tinkerers from around the world.

## Acknowledgments
We'd like to thank all of our friends, seniors, and teachers from the Hwa Chong Infocomm and Robotics Society for giving
us the resources to explore and experiment.

We'd like to thank the open source communities that put together Pybricks, ev3dev, and MicroPython, the technologies
upon which this project was built.

And last but not least, none of this would have been possible without Pheasant's dedicated and brilliant members:
Tianshi, Brian, and Stephanie.

## Technologies
This project was coded in MicroPython using Pybricks APIs, and runs on a Lego Mindstorms EV3 Intelligent Brick with the
ev3dev operating system.

## Contributing
The WRO 2021 competition season is over. This repository is no longer being maintained.
